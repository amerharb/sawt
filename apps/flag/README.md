# Flag

Small react project to show country flags (as emoji) and pronounce the country
name out loud in the selected language. Sister project of
[Number](../number); national anthems now live in
[Anthem](https://github.com/amerharb/anthem).

## How it works
Pick a language from the dropdown in the top right, then click a flag to hear
the country's name spoken and see it written.

The interface is separately available in eight languages: English, Arabic,
German, Greek, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Simplified Chinese.

### URL parameters
For a shareable deep link. Every value is checked against what the app actually
has, and a parameter with nothing usable left in it is **ignored** rather than
applied — so a mistyped code cannot leave you with a blank screen.

- `i` — items: which countries are shown, e.g. `?i=us,de,fr`
- `l` — interface language, e.g. `?l=ar`
- `s` — sound: which spoken languages are shown, the **first** selected, e.g. `?s=en,ar`
- `t` — theme: `system`, `light` or `dark`

Example: `/?i=us,de,fr&s=ar,en&l=ar&t=dark`

List order does not affect the on-screen order.

You do not have to build these links by hand: **🔗 in the settings panel copies a
link to what you are looking at now** — the visible countries, the spoken languages
with the selected one first, the interface language and the theme.

Two things are left out on purpose: `i` when nothing is hidden, because "everything"
is what the app shows anyway, and `t` for `system`, which means "follow the device"
rather than a choice worth pinning on someone else's screen.

- Mute (🔊/🔇, right of 🕹️): silences everything — names, game prompts and
  feedback sounds — until clicked again.
- Settings (⚙️ top right): theme (system / light / dark, system is the
  default), flag sort order (⇵ 🌐 by code, 🔤 by name, 🎲 random), a language
  checklist and a flag grid to show/hide anything on the main screen (with ✅/⬜
  select-all/deselect-all buttons), a flight mode toggle (✈️), cache info (🔊
  count and a 🗑️ clear button), and 🔗 to copy a share link to the current
  settings. Saved in localStorage, remembered between visits.
- Flight mode (✈️): downloads all visible sounds to the cache; anything newly
  shown while it is on is downloaded right away. Turning it off keeps the
  cached files.
- Game (🕹️ in the top bar): start a guessing game — a random country name is
  spoken and you tap the matching flag (👍 correct, 👎 wrong). Stuck? The
  give-up button (🤷‍♂️) reveals it (tracked separately from mistakes). It runs
  through every visible country, with your progress (played,
  mistakes, give-ups, time) shown live in the app bar next to the round
  buttons. The prompted name is also written in the display segment (even
  while muted), and the 👂 button plays it again. When every country has been played the round is over — the clock
  freezes and the score stays — but game mode stays on: ⏹️ stops a round that is
  running and ▶️ starts the next, and pressing 🕹️ again leaves game mode. Theme and flight mode
  stay changeable mid-game; the language and country lists are locked, and the
  selected language can be changed only between rounds (after ⏹️ or when a
  round finishes). Needs at least one language and one country visible.
- First visit: the interface language comes from your browser's language settings
  (English if we have no dictionary for it), and the spoken language starts on that
  same language when we have sounds for it. Every spoken language is visible —
  nothing starts hidden.

## How to contribute
### Media files
To support a new country, one sound file in AAC format is needed per language,
with the spoken country name.

Audio files live under `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<country-code>.aac`, for example
`public/sound/lang/en/ps.aac` for Palestine in English.

### Coding
Flag is an open source project built on Vite, React 19, TypeScript v6.x
and npm. All the code is Frontend, no backend needed.

To add a country:
1. Create `src/countries/<code>.ts` exporting a `Country` (`code`, `name`, `flag`)
   with the name in every supported language.
2. Import it and add it to the `COUNTRIES` array in `src/App.tsx`.
3. Drop the audio files at `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<code>.aac`.

To add a language:
1. Add its code to the `Language` type in `src/countries/Country.ts` —
   TypeScript will then point out every country file missing the new name.
2. Add it to the `LANGUAGES` array in `src/App.tsx`.
3. Drop the audio files at `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<code>.aac`.

#### Setup environment
- Node 20.19 or above
- npm 9.x or above
- Install `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build` (output in `dist/`)
- Start dev server: `npm start`
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`

### Deploying
Once a PR is merged to the main branch it is automatically deployed using the
Vercel integration tool with GitHub.
