# Colors

Small react project to show colors (as swatches) and display the color name in
the selected language. Sister project of
[Flags](https://github.com/amerharb/flags).

## Colors supported
- Red `#F00`
- Orange `#F70`
- Pink `#F7B`
- Yellow `#FF0`
- Green `#0F0`
- Blue `#00F`
- Purple `#707`
- Black `#000`
- White `#FFF`

Colors are defined with 3-digit hex codes.

## Languages supported
Spoken (what you hear and guess):
- English
- Arabic
- German
- Swedish
- Ukrainian
- Hebrew

The interface is separately available in eight languages: English, Arabic,
German, Greek, Swedish, Thai, Turkish and Simplified Chinese.

## URL parameters
For a shareable deep link. Every value is checked against what the app actually
has, and a parameter with nothing usable left in it is **ignored** rather than
applied — so a mistyped code cannot leave you with a blank screen.

- `i` — items: which colours are shown, e.g. `?i=f00,0f0,00f`
- `l` — interface language, e.g. `?l=ar`
- `s` — sound: which spoken languages are shown, the **first** selected, e.g. `?s=en,ar`
- `t` — theme: `system`, `light` or `dark`

Example: `/?i=f00,0f0&s=de,en&l=de`

List order does not affect the on-screen order.

## How it works
Pick a language from the dropdown in the top right, then click a color swatch to
hear its name spoken and see it written in that language. Click the swatch again
(▶ while it plays) to stop.

- Mute (🔊/🔇, right of 🕹️): silences everything — names, game prompts and
  feedback sounds — until clicked again.
- Settings (⚙️ top right): theme (system / light / dark, system is the default),
  a language checklist and a color grid to show/hide anything on the main screen
  (with ✅/⬜ select-all/deselect-all buttons), a flight mode toggle (✈️), and
  cache info (🔊 count and a 🗑️ clear button). Saved in localStorage, remembered
  between visits.
- Flight mode (✈️): downloads all visible sounds into the browser's Cache Storage
  so they play offline; anything newly shown while it is on is downloaded right
  away. Turning it off keeps the cached files (🗑️ clears them).
- Game (🕹️ in the top bar): start a guessing game — a random color name is spoken
  and you tap the matching swatch (👍 correct, 👎 wrong). Stuck? The give-up
  button (🤷‍♂️) reveals it (tracked separately from mistakes). It runs through
  every visible color, with your progress (played,
  mistakes, give-ups, time) shown live in the app bar next to the round
  buttons. The prompted name is also written in the display segment (even
  while muted), and the 👂 button plays it again. When every color has been played the round is over — the clock
  freezes and the score stays — but game mode stays on: ⏹️ stops a round that is
  running and ▶️ starts the next, and pressing 🕹️ again leaves game mode. Theme and flight mode stay
  changeable mid-game; the language and color lists are locked, and the selected
  language can be changed only between rounds (after ⏹️ or when a round
  finishes). Needs at least one language and one color visible.
- First visit: the starting language and which languages are shown come from your
  browser's language settings.

## How to contribute
### Media files
Each color has one sound file in AAC format per language, with the spoken color
name. Audio files live under `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<code>.aac`, for example
`public/sound/lang/en/f00.aac` for Red in English (the `<code>` is the color's
3-digit hex).

### Coding
Colors is an open source project built on Vite, React 19, TypeScript v6.x and
npm. All the code is Frontend, no backend needed.

To add a color:
1. Create `src/colors/<code>.ts` exporting a `Color` (`code`, `name`) with the
   name in every supported language.
2. Import it and add it to the `ALL_COLORS` array in `src/App.tsx`.
3. Drop the audio files at `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<code>.aac`.

To add a language:
1. Add its code to the `Language` type in `src/colors/Color.ts` — TypeScript will
   then point out every color file missing the new name.
2. Add it to the `LANGUAGE_DEFS` array in `src/App.tsx` and to `SPOKEN_LANGUAGES`
   in `src/settingsStore.ts`.
3. Drop the audio files at `public/sound/lang/<lang>/<code>.aac`.

#### Setup environment
- Node 20.19 or above
- npm 9.x or above
- Install `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build` (output in `dist/`)
- Start dev server: `npm start`
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`

## Credits
### For sound
Color name pronunciations synthesized with Microsoft Edge neural
text-to-speech voices: English (Ava), Arabic (Amany), German (Katja),
Swedish (Sofie), Ukrainian (Polina) and Hebrew (Hila), like the sister projects.
The game's correct/wrong feedback sounds are shared with the
[Flags](https://github.com/amerharb/flags) sister project.
